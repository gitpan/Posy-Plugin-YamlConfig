==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::YamlConfig - Posy plugin to read config files in YAML format


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::YamlConfig.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This uses the YAML module to parse config files, instead of the default
name:value format. This enables config values to be more complicated than
simple strings; they can be arrays and hashes, put in a simple format that's
user-friendly.

For a simple name:value set of config variables, the only difference between
YAML format and Posy::Core format is that the file has to start with a line
of three dashes:

    ---
    site_title: My Wonderful Site
    sort_type: path

See "YAML" for further details of YAML format. If you have problems with a
particular config file, use the ysh program to help figure out what's wrong
and fix it. (If the YAML module is installed, so should ysh be)

This replaces the 'read_config_file' method, and returns the hash of values
read.


==== REQUIRES ====
